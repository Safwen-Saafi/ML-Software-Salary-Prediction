# Software-Developer-Salary-Prediction-WebApp<br/><br/>


## Overview

### This project features an interactive web application that predicts the salary of software developers based on data from the Stack Overflow Survey 2023. Users can input their country, years of experience, and educational level to receive an estimated salary.<br/><br/>


## Model Development

### The machine learning model was developed using Jupyter Notebooks included in Anaconda. First I created a virtual environment where I installed all the libraries needed for the project. Then using the kernel provided by the virtual environment we created our Jupyter Notebook. The model leverages data from the Stack Overflow Survey 2023 to provide accurate salary predictions.<br/><br/>

## Web Application

### The web application is built with Streamlit Python, offering a user-friendly interface for salary estimation. The app allows users to input their specific details and obtain a salary prediction based on the trained model.<br/><br/>


## Features

### - **Country:** Select your country from the dropdown menu.
### - **Years of Experience:** Enter your total years of experience in the software development field.
### - **Educational Level:** Choose your highest level of education from the options provided.<br/><br/>
